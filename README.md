# ConGames
ConGames is a web digital game distributor made as an assignment for the 2018 edition of the "Web Development and the Semantic Web" course, by Andr√© Barreto Silveira and Eric Marchetti Santos.

## Infrastructure Setup
ConGames was created in accordance with the Jbutler tutorial. To setup ConGames, follow the [JButtler Tutorial](https://github.com/dwws-ufes/jbutler/wiki/Tutorial00) with the following differences:

1.  Wildfly 14 is the preferable choice of server.
2.  The Schema to be created in MySql Workbench should be called `congames`.
3.  When configuring the datasource in wildfly, in `standalone.xml`, instead of the datasource mentioned in the tutorial, add the following:
  
```xml
<datasource jta="true" jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/Congames" pool-name="Congames" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
	<connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/congames?useSSL=false</connection-url>
	<driver>mysql</driver>
	<security>
		<user-name>dwws</user-name>
		<password>dwws</password>
	</security>
</datasource>
```
